# Changelog

All notable changes to `@ankurhalder/codebase-snapshot`.

---

## 2.1.0

Multi-project support and an interactive setup.

### Added

- **Interactive setup.** `npm create codebase-snapshot` (or `npx @ankurhalder/codebase-snapshot init`)
  detects the project, walks every tunable parameter, and writes the config. Every
  prompt has a flag, so it works non-interactively in CI.
- **A self-documenting config.** The generated `snapshot.config.mjs` lists *every*
  setting at its current value, commented and grouped — not just the ones you
  changed. Deleting any line is safe. `--minimal` writes the terse variant.
- **25 presets**, up from 4: nextjs, nuxt, sveltekit, remix, astro, angular,
  solid, vue-vite, react-vite, nest, node-express, node-lib, python-django,
  python-fastapi, python-lib, go, rust, java-spring, dotnet, php-laravel,
  ruby-rails, monorepo, infra, docs, generic.
- **Per-ecosystem ignores** contributed by each preset — `__pycache__`, `.venv`,
  `.mypy_cache` (Python), `target` (Rust), `.gradle` (JVM), `bin`/`obj` (.NET),
  `vendor`/`storage` (PHP), `.svelte-kit`/`.angular`/`.astro` (JS frameworks) —
  merged with `excludePatterns` and still recorded per file.
- **Structural summaries for non-TypeScript languages.** Python, Go, Rust,
  Java/Kotlin/Scala, C#, PHP, Ruby and C/C++ now get imports, declarations and
  exports. Vue/Svelte/Astro components have their `<script>` block handed to the
  real TypeScript compiler.
- **`summaryQuality`** (`ast` / `structural` / `heuristic`) recorded per file and
  rendered in every part section, so a line-scan is never presented as a parse.
- **`preset`** option to force a preset by name; an unknown name is an error with
  the full list rather than a silent fallback.

### Changed

- Preset detection now reads the repository once per run and shares that view
  with every detector. `peerDependencies` and `optionalDependencies` count.
- A bare `package.json` ranks below any definitive language manifest, so a Go or
  Rust repo with a `package.json` for tooling is not mistaken for a Node library.

### Fixed

- Summaries for `.jsonc` strip comments instead of reporting `invalid-json`.
- `export default function Foo` records both `Foo` and `default`.
- Parser diagnostics are counted and surfaced as warnings.

## 2.0.0

Configurable snapshots, `explain`/`diff` commands and correctness fixes.

### Added

- `artifacts`: switch each of the seven artifacts off individually, with
  `--skip-artifacts` and `--only-artifacts`.
- `include`: allow-list globs, applied before `excludePatterns`.
- `budgets.byLayer`: per-layer part budgets.
- `layersMode`: user layers merge with the detected preset by default.
- `hooks.afterGenerate`.
- `snap explain <path>` and `snap diff <a> <b>`.
- `generate --watch`.
- Byte budgets accept human sizes (`120k`, `1.5mb`) from CLI and config.
- Globs support brace groups and character classes (`*.{ts,tsx}`, `[abc]`).

### Fixed

- The monolith is built from pre-partition content, so `full-codebase.*` really is
  the whole codebase even when a part truncates a file.
- The part byte bound is enforced after the split-pass cap instead of being
  silently exceeded.
- Default-ignored files are recorded with `reason: "default-ignore"` instead of
  vanishing, including leftover `snapshot.backup-*` directories.
- Watch mode no longer retriggers itself on its own writes.
